# Master Thesis Template

This directory contains all the latex files that you will need to write your master thesis. Please read the instructions carefully below. 


## Building
Simply execute `make all` in order to build the thesis. `make all` might run slow, as it tries to find references and build the bibliography. Run `make` in case you did not add any references since the last build.

## Cleaning Up
In case you run into weird problems, try to `make clean` in order to delete any temporary files that are required by latex.
