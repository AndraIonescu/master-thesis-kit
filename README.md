# Master Thesis Project in the Delta team

This repository contains instructions for how to start your thesis, write your research proposal and then your thesis. You are advised to fork this repository and use it from the beigninning of the thesis up to its completion. 

## Templates
This repository contains a [proposal template](proposal), a [literature review template](literature-review) (note: not all students need a separate literature review; talk to your advisor about this), as well as a [master thesis Template](thesis). You do not have to use them, but you are advised to do so.

## Master Thesis Process

- Most important step: **read the [manual](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/student/faculties/eemcs-student-portal/education/graduation-policy-msc/summary-of-procedure/)**. Your advisor will never have to remind you of any of the things mentioned in there. It's your own responsibility to remind your advisor of each step, with an email (e.g., to create a committee for the thesis, to schedule a thesis defense, etc.). 
- Write a research proposal. Read the guide on how to write a research proposal, along with the template. 
- Send an email to Geert-Jan Houben and setup a meeting with him.
- After Geert-Jan Houben approves the thesis plan, he will have to sign a couple of forms you are officially a MSc thesis candidate with a clear subject and plan.
- Start executing on the plan.

In case you are performing a thesis in a company, also make sure that you:

- Bring your advisor in contact with the company representative.
- Prepare all the paperwork (NDA's, etc.) for your daily advisor.
- A piece of advice: companies might have a different idea than you, on what a thesis is all about. A Master thesis in a company is not about reporting back to us what you did during the internship. Just like a normal thesis, hosted by a university, a thesis at the industry should be a scientific artifact with concrete contributions.
